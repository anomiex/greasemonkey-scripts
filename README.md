# GreaseMonkey Scripts

These are [GreaseMonkey] scripts that I've written and think others might find useful. They may also work with other browser addons such as [TamperMonkey].

## Installation

First, you have to install an appropriate script manager. You might check the [Greasy Fork's page on user script installations](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) for help with that.

Once you have a script manager installed, you should be able to click the links below.

### GitHub Check Sorter

[Download GitHub Check Sorter](https://github.com/anomiex/greasemonkey-scripts/raw/master/github-check-sorter.user.js)

GitHub Actions are really nice for running CI checks. But GitHub doesn't *sort* the list of checks, so you have to look through a randomly-ordered list to find the ones you care about.

This script sorts the checks by status, and then alphabetically by the displayed title.
